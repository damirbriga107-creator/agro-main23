1. **API Gateway** (`:3000`) - Entry point with routing, authentication, circuit breaker
2. **Auth Service** (`:3001`) - User authentication, JWT management, RBAC
3. **Financial Service** (`:3002`) - Financial tracking, budgets, transactions
4. **Subsidy Service** (`:3003`) - Government subsidy management
5. **Insurance Service** (`:3004`) - Insurance policies and claims
6. **Analytics Service** (`:3005`) - Business intelligence, reporting, dashboards
7. **Document Service** (`:3006`) - Document management and storage
8. **Notification Service** (`:3007`) - Email, SMS, push notifications
9. **IoT Service** (`:3008`) - IoT device management, sensor data processing

### Infrastructure Components
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary relational database
- **MongoDB** - Document storage
- **Redis** - Caching and session management
- **Kafka** - Event streaming and async communication
- **ClickHouse** - Analytics database
- **Elasticsearch** - Search and indexing
- **MQTT** - IoT device communication

### Shared Libraries
- `@daorsagro/config` - Configuration management
- `@daorsagro/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `@daorsagro/utils` - Database connections, logging, utilities

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run validate          # Validate platform setup
npm run health:check      # Check service health
npm run setup:dev         # Complete development setup
npm run docker:up         # Start all services
npm run docker:down       # Stop all services
npm run docker:logs       # View service logs
npm run dev               # Start development mode
npm run build             # Build all services
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run lint              # Lint all code
```

### Validation & Testing
- **Setup validation**: Checks all files, configurations, and dependencies
- **Health monitoring**: Tests service connectivity and response times

- **Kubernetes ready**: Health probes for K8s deployment

## üìö Documentation
- `docs/HEALTH_CHECKS.md` - Comprehensive health check and monitoring guide
- `scripts/validate-setup.js` - Platform validation script
- `scripts/health-check.js` - Service connectivity testing
- Environment templates with detailed configuration options

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run validation**: `npm run validate`
2. **Start services**: `npm run setup:dev`
3. **Access platform**: http://localhost:3000
4. **Monitor health**: http://localhost:3000/api/services
5. **View documentation**: http://localhost:3000/api-docs

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Check URLs
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health    # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3001/health    # Auth Service
curl http://localhost:3002/health    # Financial Service
# ... (all 8 services)
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Service metrics at `/metrics` endpoints
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource usage tracking

### Troubleshooting
1. Check service logs: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
2. Restart services: `docker-compose restart [service-name]`
3. Validate setup: `npm run validate`
4. Check connectivity: `npm run health:check`
